# TripleTen-Project

In this project, I used a car sales advertisements dataset to produce interactive plots and ultimately a web application. In particular, I was interested in the relationship between car prices and the number of days they were listed among different car types. Additionally, I was interested in how odometer reading distributions varied according to the car condition. Some important packages I used throughout this project include plotly.express, pandas, numpy, and streamlit.
